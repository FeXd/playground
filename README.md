# 🛝Playground  
A place for _experimentation_, _learning_, and _testing_. I often find myself struggling with the question "_where should this live_", which gets in the way of actually making a thing. Less thinking, more doing. **Don't think about it, just put it here.** It might turn into something magical or be forgotten and abandoned. It's fine either way to be honest.

# 💻 Technology  
Web technologies only please. Likely just **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Maybe a few frameworks and libraries. 

# 🪶 Philosophy 
I try to write code that _beginners can understand_. Keep everything **simple**. Avoid being overly **complex** or caring too much about **optimization**. Validate everything and care about accessibility.

# ✍️ Contribute  
Sorry, I'm not really looking for contributors. But feel free to reach out if you have a comment or question. Why not **start your own playground**?
